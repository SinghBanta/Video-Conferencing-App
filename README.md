## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

I have used platform Zegocloud to integrate video conferencing in this NextJs Project.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
